System Option A — Real-Time Price Ticker (recommended)

Backend (Python):

A price generator coroutine

A WebSocket server that broadcasts prices

A simple /snapshot REST endpoint returning the latest price

Frontend (React/TS):

A useEffect WebSocket subscription

A small UI tile showing:

current price

last updated

price color (green if rising, red if falling)

You must make these decisions and narrate them:

How to decouple feed → broadcaster

How to handle subscriber join/leave

What happens if backend sends messages too rapidly

Whether UI stores local history or requests it

This maps exactly to Jump’s real-time UI work.

<thoughts>
price_generator -> asyncio.Queue -> websocket broadcaster
for subscribers:
  maintain a set of websockets.
  on connect(): add a websocket to the set
  on disconnect(): remove the websocket from the set

if the queue grows and has too many ticks:
  choose lastest only.

lets use local history
</thoughts>
