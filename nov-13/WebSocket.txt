Prompt F — WebSocket broadcast (no framework)

Define the internal logic for:

A list of connected clients

A function broadcast(message) that sends to all

How this avoids spawning separate loops per client

What happens if a client hangs

How to avoid the entire system stalling

Don’t code the full WebSocket server, just sketch the design and narrate.

----

clients connect to backend
backend has a websocket server for all clients
via websocket, broadcasts to all

clients all operate on one backend, and one websocket

if a client hangs, thats fine. since the websocket doesnt depend on the client, the client will just receive the next packet

to prevent the entire system stalling u could use redis or caching to show stale data, better than no data, or just an error message.
