Prompt G — Designing a Mini Notification System

Engineer asks:
“Build the backend + class model for a notification panel that stores notifications, marks them read/unread, and streams new ones to the UI.”

You outline:

A Notification class

A NotificationManager service

A WebSocket push method

API routes

A React component (high-level)

Checkpoints:

How would you paginate?

How would you handle concurrent writes?

How do you model read/unread state for many users?

----

Notification class would have a constructor of:
id of a number -> uuid
notification of type text 
isRead of type bool, and initialized to false on default

a notificationmanager class would take nothing for a constructor but also have an internal hashmap where id maps to each notifiation object
could be the id attached to the notifiaciton object

basically, fast lookup is all we want here.

then, setting up the notifiaciton manager. we can use the web socket send function to send data from the frontend to the backend since its bidirectional

um, if we're sending data frmo the back to the frontend we can use a middleware to normalize the data send via a function and or normalize into a json for the react component

which, appends or rather hashes to the hash map, and we detect changes via things like the spread operator in a sense or like, append or yea

okay, so we use the send to create a randomized message and uuid and pack it to a notificaiton object, append that to the notifiaciton manager
